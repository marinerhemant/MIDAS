          # It uses "${CMAKE_OPTIONS[@]}". We might need to modify build.sh or just run cmake directly if build.sh is too rigid.
          # However, let's try to simulate what build_wsl_windows.sh does within the constraint of build.sh if possible,
          # or just run the cmake commands directly in the CI like build_wsl_windows.sh does.
          
          # Actually, build_wsl_windows.sh runs cmake directly. It might be safer to do that in CI too 
          # to ensure specific flags are passed.
          # But let's try to stick to build.sh if we can, or modify build.sh to accept extra args.
          # For now, let's just run the commands directly in CI as it gives more control.
